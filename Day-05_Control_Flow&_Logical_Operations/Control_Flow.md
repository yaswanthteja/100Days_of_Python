## Flow  Control  


Flow control describes the order in which statements will be executed at runtime.





# Conditional Statements
In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false. You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition. Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.



## 1.  if
```
if condition : statement
 or
if condition :
 statement-1
 statement-2

 ```
If condition is true then statements will be executed
