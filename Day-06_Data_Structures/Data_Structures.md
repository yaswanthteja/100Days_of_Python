# Data Structures:
Data structures are containers or ways to organize and store data in memory. They provide a way to group related data elements together and define the relationships between them. In Python, there are several built-in data structures, including:

- `Lists`: Ordered collection of items.
- `Tuples`: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
- `Dictionaries`: Collection of key-value pairs.
- `Sets`: Unordered collection of unique elements.
- `Arrays`: Homogeneous collection of items.
- `Linked Lists`, `Stacks`, `Queues`, `Trees`, etc. (implemented using classes and objects)

Data structures allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. They provide different methods and operations to work with the data they contain.


# Collection Types
There are a number of collection types in Python. While types such as int and str hold a single value, collection
types hold multiple values.
